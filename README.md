# 🧠 Pneumonia and COVID-19 Prediction Using Deep Learning (End-to-End Flask App)

This is a full-stack deep learning project that predicts **Pneumonia**, **COVID-19**, or **Normal** conditions from chest X-ray images. It includes data preprocessing, CNN model training, evaluation, and a fully functional **Flask web app** for real-time image classification.

---

## 📁 Dataset

We use chest X-ray image datasets labeled for:
- **Normal**
- **Pneumonia**
- **COVID-19**

## 🧪 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-covid-prediction.git
   cd pneumonia-covid-prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
